Fantastic selection of music and the current update allowing you now to stream music over your own data allowance is a big plus. Downsides though, it could be a little more creative with the selection of 'comparable artists' when it comes to your own offline station, I find that the same things are repeated constantly. A major technical downside, is the constant dropout of wifi signal with the app. I have 100mg broadband in the house and a very strong wifi signal.

A sleep timer would be a fab addition as I like to have music while I drift off but means music plays all night long.Good range of music and a really clever algorithm is used so that it plays songs you like and similar. Good job :) Except now there are ads and it's getting really annoying!! Enough!",5

Tue Apr 22 21:25:00 BST 2014,981312425,Amybabycake,Average/not good,"In some cases this app is really good because it plays all the up to date music however there a quite a few disadvantages as it lies about working without wifi , half the time it says there is a server problem and wont play music at all . Another is that it says playing downloaded music when i have wifi . When i play music it repeats them a lot and at the moment the music on all of my stations plays roughly 7 songs on repeat. The thing that is really irritating is the adds . they play like between every 2 songs and i cant skip it . Its so annoying üò°",2
